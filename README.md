My work description @RenewPower 

Utilizing AI technology stack and ML algorithms for
  1. Rainfall prediction using radar & satellite images across Delhi region.
  2. Electricity demand forecasting for Government Of India bodies.
  3. System Application for ML modelling.
  4. IEX price forecasting and fraud detection across the energy ecosystem.




## 1. **Research**
*role- Machine Learning Engineer*
> Rainfall prediction using radar images over Delhi region, during monsoon season (accuracy margin > 95%). Use case- rainfall forecast data from 3rd party sources is highly inaccurate in monsoon season, causing high MAPE in electricity demand forecasting.
>
> Challenges 
> 1. Highly sparse data, textual noise in images
> 2. Unpredictable cloud movement and reflectivity.
> 
> Solutions  
> 1. Domain expertise and EDA to cluster similar weather conditionns
> 2. Keras OCR pipelines to remove textual noise
> 3. Prediction using attention LSTM
> 4. Use of GANs to improve output resolutions for further use

## 2. **Predictive analytics**

> Intraday, day ahead, week ahead and year ahead forecasting using NNs, RNN, ARIMA, Boosting, transfer learning (modelling time margin < 15 sec, data size > 2 GBs, mape< 1.5 for intraday and day ahead).
> 
> Clients
> 1. BRPL, BYPL (*role- Machine Learning Engineer*)
> 2. CSPTCL, PSPCL (*role- Machine Learning Lead*)
> 
> Challenges 
> 1. During uncertain weather conditions(sudden rainfall, fluctuating temperature), inaccurate weather forecast data is prevalent causing models to fail
> 
> Solutions
> 1. refine weather forecast using deep learning- rainfall prediction using radar images via frame prediction (LSTMs)
> 2. Ensemble modelling to choose models with the best forecast during different conditions
> 3. Using similarity based techniques(dynamic time warping), fuzzy logics, domain expertise to refine the forecasts

## 3. **Windows system application for modelling** 
*role- Machine Learning Lead*

> Application running 8 NN based complex models for 120 different areas, to be run simultaneously every 15 min.; each data size >5 GBs) and forecasting for next 8 days.
> 
> Clients- JKSPDC, General Electric (GE)
> 
> Challenges 
> 1. Computational complexity very high causing system failure 
> 2. Cloud systems and GPUs were prohibited
> 3. No internet connectivity 
> 
> Solutions 
> 1. Generators, parallel processing- less time complexity and runtime achieved 
> 2. EDA and domain expertise- anomalies and regularities separated to forecast better
